-   [ ] Make AI generate blog posts to use as guides
-   [ ] use icons to show max room occupancy like booking.com
-   [ ] currency conversion
-   [ ] on the checkout page, show that the latest rate expires after 10 minutes
-   [ ] hover to copy address
-   [ ] show check-in, check-out, and description in hotel card
